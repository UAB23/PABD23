    <h1>Paraipan Sorin - iOS Developer at Mozilla Firefox</h1>

<p>
    As an iOS developer at Mozilla Firefox, I am part of the iOS team responsible for developing and maintaining the
    Firefox browser for iOS devices. With a passion for mobile app development and a focus on iOS platforms, I work
    diligently to enhance the browsing experience for our users.
</p>

<p>
    My primary responsibilities revolve around designing, implementing, and testing new features for the Firefox
    browser on iOS. I work closely with a talented team of developers to ensure smooth functionality and deliver
    high-quality user experiences. Together, we strive to provide innovative solutions and stay up to date with the
    latest iOS development practices.
</p>

<p>
    One of the notable features I developed is the Zoom Page Bar. This feature allows users to adjust the zoom level
    on different website domains and ensures that the selected zoom level remains persisted. With this enhancement,
    users can personalize their browsing experience by zooming in or out on websites as per their preferences,
    improving readability and accessibility.
